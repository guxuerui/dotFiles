GLSL-shaders
============

A bundle of simple GLSL shaders for openGL.

These were written while I was learning GLSL so maybe of them don't use the best techniques to achieve the desired effect.

For learning GLSL, check out [this wonderful repo](https://github.com/radixzz/awesome-glsl) instead for excellent learning resources.
